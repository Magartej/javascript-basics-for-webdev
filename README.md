## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).
- Optional: Python or Node installed if you want to run a local static server.

### Open an example

1. Open any folder (for example `7.Js.Array/`) in the repository.
2. Open the folder's `index.html` in your browser (double-click or right-click → Open with...).

## Project structure (high level)

The repository groups examples by topic — look for folders named like `1.Js.introduction`, `7.Js.Array`, `11.Js.Events`, `13.Js.Async-Await-FetchingAPI`, and `Exercise/`.

- `index.html`, `script.js`, `new.js`, etc. — runnable example files inside topic folders.
- `Exercise/` — small exercises and solutions used during practice sessions.

Example notable folders:

- `8.Js.DOM/` — DOM manipulation examples.
- `11.Js.Events/` — event handling and bubbling examples.
- `12.Js.Callbacks.Promises/` and `13.Js.Async-Await-FetchingAPI/` — asynchronous patterns and fetch usage.

## How to use this repository

- Browse folders and open the `index.html` files to run examples.
- Read and modify `script.js` files to experiment and learn.
- Use the browser developer console (F12) for debugging and inspecting output.

## Contribution guidelines

Contributions are welcome. If you want to suggest improvements or add examples:

1. Fork the repository (or create a branch).
2. Add or improve examples, keeping them small and focused.
3. Include a short comment at the top of modified files explaining the change.
4. Open a pull request with a clear description of what you changed and why.
